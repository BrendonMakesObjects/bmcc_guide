                    Burger King
                </h6>
                <p class="textOne">
                    Burger king is located on Church st & Trinity Place which is just a couple blocks away from the
                    Fiterman Building. If you go to the second floor of this restaurant you will find the
                    sit in part, where you can grab a seat and a menu then request one of the waitresses/ waitors
                    to make an order. They will bring the food directly to you how ever you ask for it.
                    I am recommending this Burger king because it is better than the one on Fulton in my opinion
                </p>

                <p class="textTwo">
                    Shake Shack is an interesting place located on Murray St & Northend Way, right next to it is the regal cinemas 
                    theatre. Shake Shack usually has a very long line almost always but trust me its worth the wait.
                    the food there is amazing, I highly recommend eating there, the burgers are better than the ones sold
                    in whole foods which are over priced...

                <p class="textThree">
                    On 53rd Park Place is where you will find Amish Market which has the 
                    best pizza around BMCC area unlike that generic 
                    pizza sold in the main building 
                    cafeteria, also when you go to Amish you get a 10% discount for showing you BMCC I.D. this discount 
                    applies to everything except sandwiches. However, when you do buy a sandwich and a bottle of water
                    then show your I.D. the water bottle is completely free.
